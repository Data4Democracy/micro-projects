# Mapping the D4D Slack Channel Ecosystem

**Project Description:**  
The D4D Slack is a a rich ecosystem, but it's a bit beastly to identify which of the nearly 200 channels one may want to join! We're building a roadmap to help members know where to find the location/interest/language/package/project channels they want to follow would improve the onboarding experience, as well as help existing members keep up with what's new.

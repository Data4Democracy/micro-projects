##ORGANIZATION

[The United Nations Children's Fund](https://www.unicef.org/) is a United Nations programme headquartered in New York City that provides humanitarian and developmental assistance to children and mothers in developing countries.


 

##COMMUNICATION GOALS

Refugee and migrant children must be protected against trafficking and exploitation and given the same access to services, including protection, health and education, as other children in the community.
Under no circumstances should children be locked up just because they are refugees or migrants, or sent back to their home countries if they face harm or death there.
Unaccompanied or separated children must be kept safe. Family reunification is often the best way to do this.
Safe and sustainable legal global pathways for migration must be established, and root causes of irregular migration, such as conflict, poverty and climate, must be addressed.
 

##PROJECT

Create (you can choose to create one or more visualizations):  

* An in depth dashboard or (tableau) story on the situation of refugees and migrant children worldwide. 
* An interactive infographic or gif that’s based on this data – something that’s a bit more geared towards a broader less technically inclined audience. 
* A country dashboard (so that a UNICEF country office for example could showcase the situation from their perspective).
* Any data visualization that you think will attract the attention for this issue.

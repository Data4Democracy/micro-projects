# Micro-projects

**Slack:** #micro-projects and #onboarding

**Project Description:**  
A series of very small-scope projects that don't merit spinning up a full-blown stand-alone project. 

**Project Lead:**
@gecky

### Getting started:
* We welcome contributions from first timers
* Browse our help wanted issues. See if there is anything that interests you.
* Core maintainers and project leads are responsible for reviewing and merging all pull requests. In order to prevent frustrations with your first PR we recommend you reach out to our core maintainers who can help you through your first PR.
* Need to practice working with github in a group setting? Checkout [github-playground](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/github-playground)
* Updates to documentation or readme are greatly appreciated and make for a great first PR. They do not need to be discussed in advance and will be merged as soon as possible.

### Outline
This repo will contain multiple folders, each focused on a project with a very small scope.  Please feel free to propose additional projects by submitting an Issue!  The goal is to create a space where newcomers, people looking to practice new skills, and time-constrained individuals can make contributions.


### Skills
Skills required will vary by project, but these small projects should be a great way to learn - both by doing them and seeing what others have done!


### Micro-projects
* Mapping the D4D Slack Channel Ecosystem
* Visualization of data on refugee and migrant children via [Viz for Social Good and UNICEF](https://www.vizforsocialgood.com/united-nations-childrens-fund) - their challenge had a 1 Feb. 2017 (11:59PM PST) deadline, but given the current immigration policy crisis, consideration of these data can be useful beyond that date.
